        <p> <b>Display Block how it Works! </b></p>
        <p> Compared to display: inline, the major difference is that display: inline-block allows to set a 
            width and height on the element.
            Also, with display: inline-block, the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected, but with 
            display: inline they are not.
            <span style="display: block; width: 100px; height: 200; background-color: brown;border: 3px green; color: cornsilk;">
            I'm Here HIIII!
            </span>
            Compared to display: block, the major difference is that display: inline-block does not add a 
            line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements.
